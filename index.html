<br>I chose this game due to my very small history of playing video games and my love for the ancient histories.
I don't play many games but this is the one that I'm currently trying out. 
Because of its rogue-like gameplay, this also ties back to the "triumph over obstacles" idea stated in Lindley's paper.</br>
