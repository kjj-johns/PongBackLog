<br>
  <center>I chose this game due to my very small history of playing video games and my love for the ancient histories.
I don't play many games but this is the one that I'm currently trying out. 
Because of its rogue-like gameplay, this also ties back to the "triumph over obstacles" idea stated in Lindley's paper.</center></br>

<br> <center> While the trailer is mainly in 2D animation, the actual game has a mix of both 2D and 3D. </center>

  <br> <center><b>Now let's move onto the fun aspects about the game...</b></center>
  <center><b>First, the artwork</b></center>

  <br><center> The first track is called <i>No Escape</i> setting the mood and tone for this rogue-like game. 
    Zagreus, the protagonist and player character, struggles to leave the confines of his home, the House of Hades, and venture across the Ungerworld in search for the truth.
