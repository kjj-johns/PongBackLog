    I chose this game due to my very small history of playing video games and my love for the ancient histories.
I don't play many games but this is the one that I'm currently trying out. I like it so far because of the quality of the characters, the worldbuilding and story progression, and its ability to be replayed over and over without being monotonous.  
  Zagreus, the protagonist and player character, struggles to leave both his Palace and the Underworld in order to find the truth to some pressing questions he has.
  Along the way, he meets his relatives, the Greek Pantheon or Olympians, creatures and souls of the underworld, and some unlikely friends.
  While there is no true ending mechanically, the story does end after Zagreus manages to get 'top-side' and have all his questions answered. 
    Its rogue-like play style allows for endless runs even after the story lines have been completed. 
    Each run is unique because of the different boons and upgrades randomly spawning along his journey, with different weapon and keepsake combinations. There is a full array of choices the player can customize for their preferred playstyle. These weapons can also be upgraded and changed after the player reaches a certain point in the narrative. 
    This playstyle ties back to the "triumph over obstacles" idea stated in Lindley's paper  due to its replay ability and Zagreus' progression narratively (note 1). 
      The game is not only compelling in its amazing attention to detail everywhere, but how thorough the developers and teams were in every aspect of the game. 
      Each character has depth to them, the different levels have a richness and feel full of 'life' (or well death since it is the Underworld), and the background elements are fully emmersive. The Hades soundtrack is 30 tracks long and is free to download if the player has bought the physical game. 
    It's the little details that make this game so worthwile to me. </p></center></br>

<br> <center> <p class="big"> While the trailer is mainly in 2D animation, the actual game has a mix of both 2D and 3D. 
  It is a top-down dungeon crawler type utilizing 2D sprites and nagivation, 3D splash artworks and effects, and surround sownd to fully emerse the player into the Underworld. 
  This trailer helps showcase the tone of the game, like the music that will be mentioned later on, and the overall goal to escape.  </p></center>

  <br> <center><b>Now let's move onto the fun aspects about the game...</b></center>
  <center><b>First, the artwork</b></center>
<br><img src="hades.zag.concept.jpg"> <img src="hades.eury.jpg"> </br>
<br><img src="hades.nyx.png"> <img src="hades.than.png"></br>
<br><img src="hades.hades.png"> <img src="hades.launch.jpg"> <img src="cerby.png"></br>
<br><center><p class="big"> All of the artwork is hand drawn, utilizing vibrant colors and cell-shading. Each family has their own colors too which I found to be a nice touch. 
  Hades and Zagreus both wear red while Nyx (pictured above in purples and starry hair) and Thanatos (with the sythe) wear cool purples and blacks and have cooler skin tones. Even Cerberus, the mythological three-headed hound of the Underworld, is all red like his family. 
  Hypnos dons both the family colors: the cool tones of his family and the reds of his employers (as seen in the poster).
  The other character's concept art shown here belongs to the NPC Eurydice. Zagreus meets her in Asphodel, and she offers a variety of items to him with each visit. As a nymph, her colors reflect nature. 
  The cell-shading is actually my favorite part. It brings so much life and character depth to each individual.</p> </center>

  <center><p class="big">This first track is notably named <i>No Escape</i>, a very pointed remark Hades often makes upon Zagreus' return to the Palace. 
    It sets the mood and tone for the game right from the start. 
    It is correct; There is no hope of escaping when each death brings him back to the beginning. This music is normally played in the main menu.
    Pointing to Lindley's paper again, Zagreus gets better with each run (whether by player experience, God/Hell Mode, Daedalus Hammer upgrades, Darkness) leading the player to enjoy the struggle and little victories (note 1).
    As a nod to Anzieu's article as well, this track sets up the poor relationship Zagreus and his father, Hades (note 2). In the beginning, Zagreus is silently crying out to his father by his repeated escape attempts. He's trying to leave to find answers nobody will give him. 
    These same people urge him to take up his father's mantle and help with princely duties. It's a negative way to begin the game. Hades believes there is <i>no escape</i> from this title, the exptations from his family, and his birthright; and puts Zagreus down with every failed escape attempt.
    Over the course of the narrative, Hades and Zagreus rebuild that broken relationship. Most of Hades' negativity stems from the emotions surrounding his missing wife, Persephone, unbeknownst to Zagreus until much later on. 
    While this does not match what Anzieu formulated about the sonorous envelope developing at infantcy, Zagreus does display the common signs of being surrounded by a negative envelope by those he is closest to. One question plaguing his mind is the answer about his mother's identity. 
    Growing up, he thought it was Nyx  and nobody corrected him (Anzieu could call these the feedback loops). Soon after the start of the game, the Zagreus finds that to be incorrect, and his real mother is Hades' missing wife. 
    Everything he knew shattered in an instant, leading to the silent cries of breaking out and refusal of duties. Throughout all this, Zagreus does remain kind and considerate of the other Palace employees and souls of the Underworld, which is a testament to his character.</p></center>
